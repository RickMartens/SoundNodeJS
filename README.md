# SoundNode

SoundNode is a simple soundboard application made using Node.JS and Electron. To use this soundboard with voice chats, please use the Installation guide below. 

## Installation

1. Save the sounds you want to use to the sounds-folder contained in this project. 
2. Install a Virtual Audio Cable like https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm.
3. Start the VAC-software and select your microphone as input. 
4. In SoundNode, select the "Input" option from the dropdown. 
5. Using the settings from the Voice Chat software you use, select the "Output" from your Virtual Audio Cable. 

Now when you play a sound, it will be wired through the Virtual Audio Cable, combined with the input from your microphone, and output to your voice chat. 

Messing around with these settings a bit more makes it possible to both hear the sound you play in SoundNode and have it wired through your voice chat. It is recommended to mess around with these settings until you find something that works for you. Have fun!
